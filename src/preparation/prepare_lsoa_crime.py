## I was going to use this data for analysis, but I realised that the LSOA Census Data has the same data. I have compared the values of their respective features, ## and they match, but a few have small differences. I think the London Metropolitan Police source is more accurate. However, the differences are very small, and ## due to some of the other limitations in the analysis, it would be feasible to omit this dataset. Therefore, I'll leave this in my final notebook, just in case ## it is needed for further analysis.
